      <h1>Objective</h1>

      <p>This need existed, so we built this thing to make everyone's life better, and learned a lot about people along the way. Did you know that 99% of all yaks have felt that booking travel is complicated and confusing?</p>

      <h1>Research</h1>
      <p>To get to know the people that this product would mean the most to, we set up our prototype in the middle of a herd of yaks and observed their behavior when trying to book a vacation. </p>

      <h1>Process</h1>
      <p>We got out our fingerpaints and started asking the really tough questions. How many yaks can fit on a Jalopy, anyway? </p>
      <p>The research drove many of our design decisions - we saw that yaks need big, tappable areas for their cloven hooves!</p>

      <h1>Identity & Design System</h1>
      <p>The personality of the brand centers around what yaks love most - green, green grass!</p>
      <p>The tone of all the messaging is designed to resonate with yaks' sarcastic wit and stubborn nature. </p>

<section class="colors">
   <p>The interface uses color consistently to communicate. Yaks freaking love these colors:</p>
   <ul class="color-chips">
      <!-- customize the colors and names in the CSS!  -->
      <li class="color-1"></li>
      <li class="color-2"></li>
      <li class="color-3"></li>
      <li class="color-4"></li>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>To sum it all up, We saw a 90% increase in satisfaction when we tested the final prototype. We eliminated all areas where yaks felt confused along the way, and let them just focus on how much grazing they'll get to do on their dream vacation!</p>
