      <h1>Overview:</h1>

      <p>This need existed, so we built this thing to make everyone's life better, and learned a lot about people along the way. Did you know that 99% of all yaks have felt that booking travel is complicated and confusing?</p>

      <h1>Background:</h1>
      <p>The original idea was to create a microinteraction with the trigger of click,that would indicate that the user had received new mail. However, the logic behind that did not work as it did not make sense for the user to have to click on a mail icon to receive new mail. As a result, I decided to make a send mail microinteraction that would make the user more excited to send out emails. The inspiration behind this idea was google teams and the exciting animations that occur when submitting an assignment. (shown below) </p>

      <h1>Process</h1>
      <p>We got out our fingerpaints and started asking the really tough questions. How many yaks can fit on a Jalopy, anyway? </p>
      <p>The research drove many of our design decisions - we saw that yaks need big, tappable areas for their cloven hooves!</p>

      <h1>The Problem:</h1>
      <p>This project seeks to improve user excitement during the email sending process. While it takes a little more time to certain users it will without a doubt liven up the usually drab email sending experience.</p>
      <h1>Goals and Objectives:</h1>
      <p>The Goal if this project to create a send email button that is more exciting than the regular one and make the user feel like their mail is actually going somewhere </p>
      <h1>Process and Insight:</h1>
      <p>The first step towards my final project goal was to have a button that interacted on hover and I had some issues creating the hover effect on the “Send Mail” button originally because some of my source code was in scss rather than css. </p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>To sum it all up, We saw a 90% increase in satisfaction when we tested the final prototype. We eliminated all areas where yaks felt confused along the way, and let them just focus on how much grazing they'll get to do on their dream vacation!</p>
