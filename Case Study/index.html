      <h1>Overview:</h1>
      
   <p>The final microinteraction I created was a "send mail" button that would trigger an animation that would make the email sending process more exciting for the user. </p>
   <p>Each week I created a different project; they were not reiterations of each other. However, throughout the term I aimed to create something that added some excitement for the user. Through this project I learned new ways of solving the issues I had and I learned the importance of microinteractions, as I now believe they can make or break a site. </p>

      <h1>Background:</h1>
      <p>The original idea was to create a microinteraction with the trigger of click,that would indicate that the user had received new mail. However, the logic behind that did not work as it did not make sense for the user to have to click on a mail icon to receive new mail. As a result, I decided to make a send mail microinteraction that would make the user more excited to send out emails. The inspiration behind this idea was google teams and the exciting animations that occur when submitting an assignment. (shown below) </p>

      <h1>The Problem:</h1>
      <p>This project seeks to improve user excitement during the email sending process. While it takes a little more time to certain users it will without a doubt liven up the usually drab email sending experience.</p>

      <h1>Goals and Objectives:</h1>
      <p>The Goal if this project to create a send email button that is more exciting than the regular one and make the user feel like their mail is actually going somewhere </p>

<h1>Process and Insight:</h1>
      <p>The first step towards my final project goal was to have a button that interacted on hover and I had some issues creating the hover effect on the “Send Mail” button originally because some of my source code was in scss rather than css. </p>

   <p>The following colors were used for the project</p>
   <ul class="color-chips">
      <!-- customize the colors and names in the CSS  -->
      <li class="color-1"></li>
      <li class="color-2"></li>

      <h1>Code Issues:</h1>
      <p>Originally, I had an issue with the code. My source style code was written in SCSS rather than CSS. Through this process of correcting the code I learned to really look at all of the details within source code as well as that there is almost always a solution to a problem you may have in your code. </p>

      <h1>Conclusion/Results:</h1>
      <p>To sum it all up, from this project and throughout the term I learned that there were always solutions to any problems in my code. Someone else has most likely had the same problem you are having, so through research and looking up the right things you can almost always find a way to fix any issues you have.</p>
         <p>In relation to the results of my final project I believe that my microinteraction achieved my intended goal of making the email sending process more exciting. In hindsight, with more time I would have conducted some user tests to prove that my microinteraction was more exciting than the current standard send email process</p>
